   - Compare to global typing standards
   - Identify if they're improving, plateauing, or declining

2. **Error Pattern Analysis:**
   - Calculate error rate per minute
   - Identify if errors are due to speed vs accuracy issues
   - Suggest specific problem areas (common mistake patterns)

3. **Speed vs Accuracy Balance:**
   - Analyze if they're sacrificing accuracy for speed
   - Recommend optimal balance for their skill level
   - Suggest when to focus on speed vs accuracy

4. **Specific Improvement Areas:**
   - Identify weak finger positions or key combinations
   - Suggest specific exercises for problem areas
   - Recommend practice duration and frequency

5. **Motivational Feedback:**
